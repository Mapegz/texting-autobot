# texting-autobot
*Python bot that sends a text file as individual messages line by line from a file, over to any platform. Basically types everything and presses enter key with a mild delay. Requires python3. Can use in WhatsApp web/ FB messanger / Instagram / Any live messenger. **NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE IN DISCORD AS IT IS AGAINST TOS** . Set delay as per your needs in the source file*.

**Does not run remotely, must be used on a local machine**. Works on windows,linux and Mac(mac not tested). 

Working is simple. Script Lightweight.
1. Create a file with the name `texttosend.txt`. 
2. Type the text you want to spam or copy paste, in lines. Each message must be on a seperate line.
3. Set delay as per your need in the python file. (can be edited using any IDE, or notepad)
4. Make sure python3 is installed. 
5. First run the `setup.bat`(windows) file or `setup.sh`(works on Ubuntu, and most probably runs on Mac, not tested). This is required only for the first time the script is executed.
6. Now, you can modify the variables as per your need.
7. After Running setups and modifying files, run the `main.py` file via terminal by typing `python3 main.py` or just open the python file by normal means. The Script will start texting!
**Important note**:- before proceeding to step 7 consider opening the software where you want to setup your spam script. As soon as the script will run, a timer comes in the terminal. It's the only time you have to go into the software's text box, after which the script will spam.
